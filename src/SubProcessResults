RESULTS
-------
Unix Process Pipe Stream communication ->
Took total 19,739,240,868 ns for iterations 100,000
Average round trip 197,392 ns

Process Socket communication ->
Took total 22,720,837,581 ns for iterations 100,000
Average round trip 227,208 ns

CONCLUSION
----------
Java process spawning subprocess could manage lower latency through process input / output stream
